Hi. I want to note that some of the fonts' size of mobile version at Figma were between 14-18px. And width of screen was shown as 375px. When i set my font and width size same at responsive design, texts were so small that i decided to make them bigger (for ex. 32px). I hope it wont be a problem (i would like to know why this happened so im gonna ask you). Sorry for the messy coding, and if any of the requirements was not been completed.
